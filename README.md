## Installation

Download the current release zip file and extract it to the Lightroom plugin folder, which is:

Mac
    `/Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Lightroom/Modules/`

Windows
    `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Lightroom\Modules`

Alternatively extract it somewhere good an go to Lightroom Module Manager and add it via the GUI.

Either there should be a plugin called "Immich" in the list, one you're finished.

## Features

* Publish images:
    * Create/rename/delete album according to published collection.
    * Upload/update/delete images from the published collection.
    * Download comments and likes from Immich to Lightroom. (If album is a shared album.)

* Export images:
    * Optionally choose or create an album to use on export to Immich.
    * Replace existing images.
    * Duplicate detection via Lightroom catalog ID, and based on date and filename.


* Upcoming features:
    * ~~Set Immich album title image from Lightroom in Published collection.~~
    * (Maybe) Additional album options like sharing in the Published Collection settings dialog.
